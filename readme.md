# Progressive enhancement exercise
## About this repo

In this repository, you can find all the files from the "progressive enhancement" exercise I finished today during my WebDev training at BeCode.

This exercise was made to learn more about HTML and CSS basics:
- HTML semantics
- HTML Accessibility
- CSS selectors
- CSS positioning (flexboxes)
- Webfonts

(for more precisions see the [instructionsExercise.md](.../master/instructionsExercice.md) file)
